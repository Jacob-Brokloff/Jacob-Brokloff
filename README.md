## About

I spend my days driving technical strategy around IBM's storage and AI portfolio — working across Fusion, Storage Scale, and Object Storage architectures to enable enterprise AI workloads.

Nights and weekends: running a homelab and building Go TUIs.

## 🔧 What I'm Building

### [`k8watch`](https://github.com/Jacob-Brokloff) *(in progress)*
> Lightweight, single-binary Kubernetes monitoring TUI — think K9s but leaner.

Built with **Go + Bubble Tea + Lip Gloss**. Catppuccin/Tokyo Night aesthetic. Targets SMB operators who live in the terminal.

### Homelab Observability Platform *(in progress)*
> Network and infrastructure monitoring TUI — a Zabbix/Grafana alternative without the overhead.

Implements automatic bottleneck identification using the **USE Method**, Linear Programming, and queueing theory.

Both tools ship as single binaries with optional AI-enhanced versions (Llama 3.3 70B / Mistral 7B via Ollama) for privacy-first, on-prem inference.
